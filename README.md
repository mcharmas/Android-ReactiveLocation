ReactiveLocation library for Android
====================================

Small library that wraps Google Play Services API in brilliant [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
```Observables``` reducing boilerplate to minimum.

Current stable version - 0.3
---------------

**This version works with Google Play Services 6.5.+ and RxJava 1.0.+**

What can you do with that?
--------------------------

* obtain last known location
* subscribe for location updates
* manage geofences
* geocode location to list of addresses
* activity recognition

How does the API look like?
----------------------------

Simple. All you need is to create ```ReactiveLocationProvider``` using your context.
All observables are already there. Examples are worth more than 1000 words:


### Getting last known location

```java
ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
locationProvider.getLastKnownLocation()
    .subscribe(new Action1<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Location location) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
        }
    });
```

Yep, Java 8 is not there yet (and on Android it will take a while) but there is
absolutely no Google Play Services LocationClient callbacks hell and there is no
clean-up you have to do.

### Subscribing for location updates

```java
LocationRequest request = LocationRequest.create() //standard GMS LocationRequest
                                  .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                                  .setNumUpdates(5)
                                  .setInterval(100);

ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
Subscription subscription = locationUpdatesObservable = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(request)
    .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
    .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
    .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
    ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
    .subscribe(new Action1<Location>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Location location) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedLocation(location);
        }
    });
```

When you are done (for example in ```onStop()```) remember to unsubscribe.

```java
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

### Subscribing for Activity Recognition

Getting activity recognition is just as simple

```java

ReactiveLocationProvider locationProvider = new ReactiveLocationProvider(context);
Subscription subscription = activityUpdatesObservable = locationProvider.getDetectedActivity(0) // detectionIntervalMillis
    .filter(...)    // you can filter location updates
    .map(...)       // you can map location to sth different
    .flatMap(...)   // or event flat map
    ...             // and do everything else that is provided by RxJava
    .subscribe(new Action1<DetectedActivity>() {
        @Override
        public void call(DetectedActivity detectedActivity) {
            doSthImportantWithObtainedActivity(detectedActivity);
        }
    });
```

### Geocode location

Do you need address for location?

```java
Observable<List<Address>> geocodeObservable = locationProvider
    .getGeocodeObservable(location.getLatitude(), location.getLongitude(), MAX_ADDRESSES);

geocodeObservable
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())               // use I/O thread to query for addresses
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())  // return result in main android thread to manipulate UI
    .subscribe(...);
```

### Managing geofences

For geofence management use `addGeofences` and `removeGeofences` methods.

### Cooler examples

Do you need location with certain accuracy but don't want to wait for it more than 4 sec? No problem.

```java
LocationRequest req = LocationRequest.create()
                         .setPriority(LocationRequest.PRIORITY_HIGH_ACCURACY)
                         .setExpirationDuration(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS))
                         .setInterval(LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL);

Observable<Location> goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable = locationProvider.getUpdatedLocation(req)
            .filter(new Func1<Location, Boolean>() {
                @Override
                public Boolean call(Location location) {
                    return location.getAccuracy() < SUFFICIENT_ACCURACY;
                }
            })
            .timeout(LOCATION_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS, TimeUnit.SECONDS, Observable.just((Location) null), AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
            .first()
            .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread());

goodEnoughQuicklyOrNothingObservable.subscribe(...);
```


How to use it?
--------------

Library is available in maven central.

### Gradle

Just use it as dependency in your *build.gradle* file
along with Google Play Services and RxJava.

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'pl.charmas.android:android-reactive-location:0.3@aar'
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:6.5.87'
    compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:1.0.3'
}
```

### Maven

Ensure you have android-maven-plugin version that support **aar** archives and add
following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>pl.charmas.android</groupId>
    <artifactId>android-reactive-location</artifactId>
    <version>0.3</version>
    <type>aar</type>
</dependency>
```

It may be necessary to add google play services and rxanroid dependency as well.
